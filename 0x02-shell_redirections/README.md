#PROJECT: Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters

##This repository contains scripts written in Bash for the 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters project as part of the DevOps curriculum at ALX School. These scripts are designed to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in using shell commands, I/O redirections, and filters.

##Explain shell and I/O redirections
-Understand the usage of commands such as head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr, rev, cut
-Redirect standard output to a file
-Get standard input from a file
-Send the output of one program as input to another program
-Combine commands and filters with redirections
-Understand and use special characters in shell scripts

A README.md file at the root of the project folder describing each script's purpose
